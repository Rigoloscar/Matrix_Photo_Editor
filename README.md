Editing images in C# with linear algebra properties
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
This software has been developed as a project for the Polytechnical University of Catalonia - BarcelonaTech, 
specifically for the double degree in Aerospace Engineering and Telecomunication Engineering.

After that being stated, submitting this project as own in any university shall be considered a punishable and henious violation of the academic law in which I DO declare to 
NOT participate, and therefore I shall be exempt of any allegations regarding such felony.

The program manages to edit images applying linear algebra properties on the RGB picture constituent matrix, being ultimately
able to resize, cut, brighten or modify some of its chromatic tones. Furthermore, the software comes with a bunch of pre-configured filters and
a presentation mode, which allows to display all images stored in a folder with a configurable timing.
